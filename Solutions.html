            <h2>Comparing Temporal Data Using Slider</h2>
            <h3>ArcGIS Pro Pre-Processing</h3>
            <p>Point data of assaults from Toronto were used in this solution. 
                There were several years of data within the point layer, but only two 
                years of data were used for this slider; 2014 and 2022. To extract each 
                of these years, a select query was used to create a 2014 point file and 
                a 2022 point file. After that, the Generate Tesselation tool was used to 
                create many empty hexagons polygons, and then the Aggregate Points tool 
                was used to populate these empty hexagons with the Toronto assault point 
                data. The symbology was then adjusted for each tesselation layer 
                (2014 and 2022) and I made sure they had the exact same ranges so the data 
                comparison was accurate.
            </p>
            <h3>Web Technology Integration</h3>
            <p>
                The two web layers were shared to ArcGIS Online in the group that our 
                eam created. A web map was then created for each layer, and the 
                transparency was adjusted to 70% for both to allow the street basemap 
                below to provide context to the tesselation layer. After both web maps were made, 
                a storymap was created and a slider was added. Within the slider, the 2014 web map 
                was added on one side, and the 2022 web map was added on the other. After the 
                storymap was published, the user would be able to use the slider and compare the 
                Toronto assault data from 2014 to 2022
            </p>

            </div>

            <h3>Issues and Limitations</h3>
            <p>At first, other group members tried to create the tesselations and aggregate them 
                with the points from the AGOL group portal. However, to aggregate the points to 
                the tesselations in ArcGIS Pro you cannot use data points from an input feature 
                service (ArcGIS Online). So whenever anyone would try and do that the input would 
                display a red x beside it and output that error. Only the person that had access 
                to that data layer was able to populate the tesselations. The only other way someone 
                else could have populated the tesselation would have been to share the geodatabase 
                (with the point layer in it) with everyone.
                The main limitation of the slider is that it only displays two years of data at once. 
                This is great if you want to view little details between two different time periods, 
                but if your desire is to view more than two time periods of data, a different type of 
                technology would be more adequate
                </p>

                    <h2>Comparing Temporal Data using Map Actions </h2>
                    <h3>ArcGIS Pro Pre-Processing</h3>
                    <p>The Historic Limit of Peterborough shapefiles were collected from the City of 
                        Peterborough Open Access Portal. The Historic Limits cover the years from 
                        1825 - 2013. The data was imported into ArcGIS Pro where each year was exported 
                        as an individual feature layer and shared to ArcGIS Online. Once the items were 
                        shared to ArcGIS Online, the feature layers were added to MapViewer where 
                        symbology from color brewer was applied to give the different historic limits 
                        color. They were also ungrouped into their individual layers 
                        (this is an important step for creating map actions). 

                    </p>
                    <h3>Web Technology Integration</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our group wanted a way to represent temporal time that was interactive and could 
                        represent more than two periods of time. Upon much research we were able to come 
                        across a solution that involved using map actions to show multiple periods of 
                        time. The use of map actions would essentially present a timeline map which would 
                        show the expansion of Peterborough's City from 1825 - 2013 and also allows users 
                        to explore the history of the city in an interactive way. 
                    </p>
                    <div class="solutions-image">
                        <img src="images/mapaction.jpg" alt="temporal-slider">
                    </div>
                    <h3>The Result</h3>
                    The user is able to interact with the City of Peterborough and click on the different 
                    periods of time in the city's history to see how the city's extent has developed over 
                    time

                    <h3>Issues and Limitations</h3>
                    <p>The use of map actions is a powerful and effective way of presenting how cities can 
                        change over time. Therefore, there is an abundant amount of information you can 
                        show in these map actions to further demonstrate the growing city of Peterborough 
                        and its history. For example, rather than just showing the historic extents, 
                        you could add significant events or landmarks which could really enhance the map 
                        and demonstrate how they shaped the city's history over time. However,  
                        time constraints and difficulty finding the appropriate data made it challenging 
                        to implement.

                            <h2>Exploring Temporal Data with Time Settings </h2>
                            <h3>Pre-Processing</h3>
                            <p>The data used for exploring time settings was the 2022 point data of 
                                Toronto crime from a shared layer in the teams group on ArcGIS Online.
                                Example data was also downloaded for reference from Esri of Southern 
                                Elephant Seal Track points layer in early 2009. 
                            </p>
                            <h3>Web Technology Integration</h3>
                            <p>
                                A recurring theme of working with temporal data is the configuration 
                                of time settings. Enabling time allows for specifying the time interval and range of the data, allowing for many different types of temporal representation cascading through Esri applications. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Time can only be enabled at a layer's item page but only on layers that 
                                are unpublished or in ArcGIS Pro before it is shared as a web layer. 
                                The main Esri documentation of configuring time assumes that enabling 
                                time settings is an option and does not go into detail about where to go 
                                if this isn't an option. For this first attempt of time configuration, 
                                the team went in search of further documentation and data with time enabled 
                                to successfully create a time slider in ArcGIS Online. Example data from 
                                Esri's online portal of Elephant Seal migration displayed these points 
                                progressively showing track points being added to the map animated with a 
                                time slider. It was at this layer's item page that time was enabled under 
                                overview details and in the mapviewer on the menu of configurable settings 
                                on the right hand side. Esri documentation was also found providing more 
                                detail and visual aids which allowed us to enable time settings on our own 
                                2022 crime data point layer.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Solving The Problem</h3>
                            <p>Once time settings were enabled for the layer, navigating time settings 
                                in the map viewer was straightforward. On the right menu, the time option 
                                is now present enabling and disabling the time slider. The time slider 
                                properties are found under settings in the left icon menu and time slider 
                                options. These settings allow the user to set an interval of time or 
                                progressively display the data, the start/end date and time along with 
                                other settings of playback speed and more.
                            </p>

                            <h3>ArcGIS Online Time Slider</h3>

                            </div>

                            <p>Since the 2022 Toronto crime point data layer now has time 
                                enabled, this allows time visualization in other ArcGIS 
                                Online applications like Experience Builder. A timeline 
                                widget using the already established time specifications from the original time slider can be used in the web app. Adding the data source for the map already created inserts the map with the data points, then from the left sidebar, drag and drop to insert the timeline widget. Then insert the same data source material and configure the time settings like you would the time slider.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Experience Builder Time Widget</h3>
                            
                            <div class="solutions-image">
                                <img src="images/experiencebuilder.jpg" alt="temporal-slider">
                            </div>

                            <h3>Issues and Limitations</h3>
                            <p>As convenient as it is to have time settings carried through the Esri environment, 
                                it is impossible to work with temporal visualization if the base layer of data 
                                does not have time enabled. These settings have to be considered from the 
                                beginning and if the layer is published or does not have time enabled, it needs 
                                to be downloaded to the desktop environment, saved in the file geodatabase of a 
                                desktop project and enabled there, to be shared again in the online environment. 
                                This was frustrating when trying to work with other layers without the time enabling 
                                option on the item page or trying to work with temporal data in experience builder 
                                without the knowledge from the above process.
