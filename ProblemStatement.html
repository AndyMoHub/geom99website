      <h2>Ideal</h2>
      <h3>People are interested in the best way to visualize and interact with temporal data.</h3>
      <p>
        Representing data that has a temporal attribute is important yet extremely challenging. 
        However, this data representation method is highly sought after due to many incidents of obtaining time stamps. 
        With this in mind, we aim to find the best method to visualize temporal data within an interactive website.

        <h2>Reality</h2>
        <h3>GIS students don't know the best way to implement this.</h3>
        <p>
            Our team of GIS students is faced with a lack of understanding on how to represent temporal data best. 
            Visually, this method of data representation is found to be highly challenging.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="problem-middle1">
        <h2>Consequences</h2>
        <h3>Students have not explored how best to visualize spatial data over time or present it in a web environment.</h3>
        <p>
            Due to the complexity and challenging aspects of working with temporal data, previous students often avoid 
            the subject together. The consequence is found within the number of resources available for demonstrating this. 
            We aim to represent the best 3D methods available. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="problem-bottom">
        <h2>Proposal</h2>
        <h3>Present temporal and spatial data in an interactive map showing the values in a 3Dimensional setting.</h3>
        <p>
            We aim to find the best method to visualize temporal data within an interactive website. 
            Walking into this, our team is open to trying many different methods to represent this data type best. 
            We aim to find the best solution through exploring multiple data types. 
            This website will give insight to the methods we used, the process steps we took and the tasks we achieved.
